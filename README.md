All artwork is distributed under IDGaF license. It means that you can use provided designs for any noncommercial purposes like creation of handout materials for conferences and meet-ups, printing wall posters for home and office and so on, but if you violate the license we will most probably do nothing, because we don't give a fuck.

#### Preview of the images and links to shirts, hoodies, mugs and stickers can be found at [linux.pictures](https://linux.pictures/) website. But, again, we don't mind if you grab the images and print them yourself in the nearest printing service to spread the word about Linux.
