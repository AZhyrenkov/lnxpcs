All artwork is distributed under IDGaF license. It means that you can use provided designs for any noncommercial purposes like creation of handout materials for conferences and meet-ups, printing wall posters for home and office and so on, but if you violate the license I will most probably do nothing, because I don't give a fuck.

If you like something and want it on a T-Shirt, you can get it [here](https://teespring.com/stores/best-linux-tees). If you can't find the shirt, please create an issue.

For custom requests please create an issue.
